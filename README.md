**Topic:** 2018 statewide testing results and teacher salary for California

**High-level description:** 
- Explore statewide testing results from 2018 for students in grades 3 - 8 and teacher salary in California. I want to see if a teacher's salary has a positive impact on statewide testing results. I am also interested in looking at the district with the highest percentage of subgroup students meeting standard. 

- If time allows, I would like to also bring in healthy kid survey results to see if those districts with the highest percentage of students meeting standards, and well-paid teachers have students who feel connected to the school.

**Data sources:** 
- California Department of Education for both student scores and teacher salary

**Data description:**
- State testing data is in a large CSV file with over 60,000 rows and about 30 columns such as: District code, School code, Grade, Percentage Standard Exceeded, Percentage Standard Met, Percentage Standard Nealy Met, Percentage Standard Not Met
- There is another CSV file that I will need to merge with the above CSV so I know which District and School is being referenced
- Teacher salary CSV will tell me for any particular district in California the lowest, average, and highest salary
