Topic: State wide testing result and teacher salary for California

High level description: Explore statewide testing results from 2018 for students in grades 3 - 8 and teacher salary in California. I want to see if teacher salary has a positive impact on statewide testing results. I am also interested in looking at the district with the highest percentage of subgroup students meeting standard. 

If time I would like to also bring in healthy kid survey results and see if districs with high percentage of students meeting standards, and well paid teachers have students who feel connected to school.

Data sources: California Department of Education for both student scores and teacher salary
