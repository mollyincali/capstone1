2019 statewide testing results and teacher salary for California

**High-level description:** 
- Explore statewide testing results from 2019 for students in grades 3 - 8 and teacher salary in California. I would like to see if a teacher's salary has a positive impact on statewide testing results.

- If time allows, I would like to also bring in healthy kid survey results to see if those districts with the highest percentage of students meeting standards, and well-paid teachers have students who feel connected to the school.

**Data sources:** 
- California Department of Education for both student scores and teacher salary

**Data description:**
- State testing data is in a large CSV file with over 60,000 rows and about 30 columns such as: District code, School code, Grade, Percentage Standard Exceeded, Percentage Standard Met, Percentage Standard Nealy Met, Percentage Standard Not Met
- There is an additional District and School CSV that will need to be merged in so I can identify Distict and School Names with their specific code
- Teacher salary data will tell me for any particular district in California the lowest, average, and highest salary
