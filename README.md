2019 statewide testing results and teacher salary for California

**High-level description:** 
- Explore statewide testing results from 2019 for students in grades 3 - 11 and teacher salary in California. I would like to see if a teacher's salary has an impact on statewide testing results.

- If time allows, I would like to also bring in healthy kid survey results to see if those districts with the highest percentage of students meeting standards, and well-paid teachers have students who feel connected to the school.

**Data sources:** 
- Three data sets all taken from California Department of Education
    1. Data set on all SBAC scores of students for the State of California
    2. Text file identifying the codes used in SBAC for County, District, and School names
    3. Data set on teacher salary by Districts in the state of California

**Data description:** 
- State testing data is in a large CSV file with over 2 million rows and about 30 columns such as: District code, School code, Grade, Percentage Standard Exceeded, Percentage Standard Met, Percentage Standard Nealy Met, Percentage Standard Not Met
- There is an additional District and School CSV that will need to be merged in so I can identify Distict and School Names with their specific code
- Teacher salary data will tell me for any particular district in California the lowest, average, and highest salary
