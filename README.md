Topic: 2018 statewide testing results and teacher salary for California

High-level description: Explore statewide testing results from 2018 for students in grades 3 - 8 and teacher salary in California. I want to see if a teacher's salary has a positive impact on statewide testing results. I am also interested in looking at the district with the highest percentage of subgroup students meeting standard. 

If time allows, I would like to also bring in healthy kid survey results to see if those districts with the highest percentage of students meeting standards, and well-paid teachers have students who feel connected to the school.

Data sources: California Department of Education for both student scores and teacher salary
